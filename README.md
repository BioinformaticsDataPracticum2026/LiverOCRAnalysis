# LiverOCRAnalysis


## Overview

This repository contains a pipeline for analyzing and comparing open chromatin regions (OCRs) in the tissue of two species. It accomplishes the following tasks:
- Mapping OCRs between species  
- Identifying shared and species-specific regions  
- Classifying regions into promoters and enhancers  
- Identifying transcription factor binding motifs  
- Performing enrichment analysis

## Structure

The repository is organized based on the main analysis steps:

- `data_qc/` – quality control of datasets  
- `alignment/` – mapping OCRs across species  
- `classification/` – promoter vs enhancer classification + shared and species-specific regions identification
- `motif_analysis/` – transcription factor motif analysis  
- `enrichment_analysis/` – biological process enrichment 
- `results/` – output files  

Other files:
- `main.py`
- `bedtools_preprocessing.py`
- `requirements.txt`
